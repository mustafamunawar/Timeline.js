## Timeline.js

Timeline.js allows complete timeline-based animation, like how Flash works. It is small, but surprisngly powerful.
Timeline.js can easily replace CSS3 keyframe animations.

Before making this library, I searched for a library that solved this problem.  Lo and behold, none could be found. There were some related libraries:
- **Snabbt**: Snabbt does not have timeline control, so that was no-go.
- **Greensock**. Greensock is not free. Moreover, it is bloated with (tens of?) thousands of lines of code. Big time no-go!

## Demo

Here is a **demo** of a page made using Timeline.js: [view demo](https://e37d8bf05815d68846fc659f89a42d2ca1b57b8c.googledrive.com/host/0B1v99s-PldDPZmY0eXlkNXpCeG8/car_dealer.html) 


## Example Code


## Goals

- **Speed and fluid animations**: We want to keep animations non-janky. These animations should be as fluid as 
- **Tiny code size**: The library itself is ~250 lines of code, which is considered *very* small. It does not require any third part library.
- **Flexible for various uses**: 
- **Elegant, maintainable code**:
